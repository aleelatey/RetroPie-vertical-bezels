# RetroPie-vertical-bezels
A collection of bezels for a portrait oriented arcade machine. Including the cabinet design.

These bezels are intended for either a cabinet with a vertical screen or playing MAME on a virtual pinball main screen.

These are for my personal table and are branded as such. I have included the layered source files so you can make your own.
